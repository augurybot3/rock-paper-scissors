# rock-paper-scissors
this is a basic rock paper scissors game.
the goal of this project was to familiarize myself with more of the javascript language and accomplish 5 goals:

1. create 3 inputs for the options of rock, paper, or scissors.
2. have those inputs record into an html element, visible to the user.
3. each time the user chooses an option, have it trigger a random response of either rock paper scissors from the 'computer' and have those results visible as well.
4. declare a winner each time and
5. tally up the # of wins for both the user and the computer and display the results on a scoreboard.
